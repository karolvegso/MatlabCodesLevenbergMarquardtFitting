# MatlabCodesLevenbergMarquardtFitting
I post here the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithms for fitting various functions such as sinus, cosinus, Gauss function with amplitude, Gauss function with area, Lorentz function with area and Voigt function. 
All m-scripts posted here are thoroughly explained at MathWorks FileExchange under my name Karol Vegso.
